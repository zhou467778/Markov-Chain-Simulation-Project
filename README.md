# Markov-Chain-Simulation-Project
### NEU Math 7241-Probability 1 final project: Markov Chain Simulation for Beijing PM2.5 Dataset

The purpose of this project is to simulate a selected time-series dataset as a Markov Chain model by the following steps:
1. Select a time-series dataset
2. Clean the dataset
3. Choose appropriate states for Markov Chain
4. Compute the empirical distribution
5. Compute the transition matrix
6. Find stationary distribution
7. Build the simulation of Markov Chain
8. Compare the simulation with the original time-series using the autocorrelation function
9. Compare the simulation with the original time-series using a goodness of fit test

The dataset used in this project is the Beijing PM2.5 Data Set, which is collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Beijing+PM2.5+Data.
